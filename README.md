# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition authentication using Python. Using the camera from your device, the program will compare the captured image with the dataset, and if the script finds more than 50% matches in the dataset, authentication is successful.

Please create a directory "images" and save the dataset images within that directory.

**Ensure all the necessary libraries are installed already!

Run the "face.py" script
